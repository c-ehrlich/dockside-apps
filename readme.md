# Dockside Tools

## What is it?
Dockside tools is a suite of tiny tools, designed to be run in the empty space to the left and right of the MacOS dock. Everything is built in very simple HTML/CSS/JS without external libraries. All apps use local storage to prevent data loss.

## Available Apps
* Notes
* Pomodoro (coming soon!)
* Time tracking (coming soon!)
* Weather (coming soon!)

## Supported Browsers
* Chrome or another Chromium-based browser such as Edge, Vivaldi, or Brave is recommended.
* Firefox works with some minor pixel-level visual differences.
* Safari is not recommended.

## Setup
* Just open index.html in a browser to see a list of apps to launch in pop-up windows.
* Safari often opens windows at a size that is different from what you ask for, so I suggest using Chrome or some another Chromium-based browser. However everything also works in Safari once you manually resize the window.
