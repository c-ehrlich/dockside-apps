Ideas for future Goals
[] The notes app should default to dark or light mode depending on system UI
[] time tracker (2-3 different things to track, change their names in settings, start and pause buttons, keep data of every day forever)
[] Weather widget using OpenWeatherMap

Version 4
[] The Notes app should have a nicer menu (do some css?)
[] The Notes app should have a place that links to my github (either in settings, or in a separate screen reached by clicking the top-left button?)
[] The Notes app themes should also include the potential for font changes
[] The skeuomorphic theme in the notes app should use a handwriting-style font (comic sans etc)
[] The JS for the Notes app should go in an external file

Version 3
[x] The notes app should have three themes, and the ability to toggle between them
  [x] Light mode (white background, black text)
  [x] Dark mode (TBD if this should be a black or dark grey background)
  [x] Skeuomorphism mode (yellow)
[x] The notes app should remember its color scheme by putting a settings object in local storage
[x] The CSS should be broken out from the html page, and into two files
  [x] 1. colors etc, used in every dockside app (to allow easy skinning)
  [x] 2. things specific to the components of the Notes app

Version 2
[x] The notes app should have a button that toggles between showing the text field 
   and a (empty for now except some placeholder text) settings/info page
[x] The notes app should have 'branding' in the top middle area
[x] The textbox in the notes app should default to a nice monospace font and fallback to default monospace

Version 1
[x] The landing page should have a link to open the notes app in a small window
[x] The landing page should have a link to open the notes app in a large window (for testing)
[x] The notes app should have a header bar that takes up 25px of vertical space
[x] The notes app should have a main div that takes up the remaining vertical space
[x] All content in the notes app should take up 100% of horizontal space
[x] The main div should contain a text field that takes up 100% of that div
[x] The text field should use local storage so the text doesn't disappear if it's closed and reopened
