Ideas for future Goals
[] The notes app should default to dark or light mode depending on system UI
[] The notes app should remember its color scheme by putting a settings object in local storage
[] The notes app should have a place that links to my github (either in settings, or in a separate screen?)

Version 3
[] The notes app should have three themes, and the ability to toggle between them
  [] Light mode (white background, black text)
  [] Dark mode (TBD if this should be a black or dark grey background)
  [] Skeuomorphism mode (yellow)

Version 2
[] The notes app should have a button that toggles between showing the text field 
   and a (empty for now except some placeholder text) settings/info page
[] The notes app should have 'branding' in the top middle area
[] The textbox in the notes app should default to a nice monospace font and fallback to default monospace

Version 1
[x] The landing page should have a link to open the notes app in a small window
[x] The landing page should have a link to open the notes app in a large window (for testing)
[x] The notes app should have a header bar that takes up 25px of vertical space
[x] The notes app should have a main div that takes up the remaining vertical space
[x] All content in the notes app should take up 100% of horizontal space
[x] The main div should contain a text field that takes up 100% of that div
[x] The text field should use local storage so the text doesn't disappear if it's closed and reopened
